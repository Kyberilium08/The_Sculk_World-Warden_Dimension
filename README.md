Welcome to the Sculk World!
This datapack for version 1.21 aims at adding vanilla-styled features to Minecraft, including:
- new sculk-themed dimension;
- new portal that leads to the aforementioned dimension;
- new enchantment - Silence;
- new music disk by Lena Raine.

The project depends on Modify Player Data and Server-Sided Portals/Cobweb. Sadly, Modify Player Data is not available on Curseforge and must be installed manually.

Guide:

- To open the portal in the ancient city, activate it with a flint and steel.
- Upon entering the new dimension you will notice a large amount of sculk sensors and shriekers. To counter them, you can use wool or the new armor enchantment - Silence. It can be applied to armor on the enchantment table. However, chances of getting the enchantment are low. You will need to re-enchant your armour until you get the desired enchantment.
- When wearing the enchantment you WILL still trigger sensors and shrieker, but the Warden will not spawn. If you want to explore the Deep Dark biome with friends, ALL of them should wear the enchantment, as the Warden's warning level is unique for each player.
- The datapack adds 3 new advancements that will guide you through the game.
- Upon entering the Sculk World, you will be rewarded with a new music disk - Ancestry/Deeper. It has a 50% chance of playing either of the two tracks upon being inserted into the jukebox, making it the first DOUBLE- sided disk in Minecraft.
- The Sculk Dimension can only generate monster rooms (dungeons), no other structures will spawn. However, the Sculk Dimension has more coal and diamond ore than the Overworld.
